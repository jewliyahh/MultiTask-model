# MultiTask-model

In `sentence_transformer_model.ipynb`, I walk through the exercise of creating a multi-task transformer model that performs sentence classification and sentiment analysis. *Note: this model has not been trained, but details on **how to train** it can be found in Step 3.*

To get started with this repo, install the requirements with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that is done, you can read through and run all the cells in `sentence_transformer_model.ipynb`. Any reasoning is fully explained in that file.

Best of luck!
